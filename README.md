Preface
=======

This is a simple example of a colored histogram overlay. It can be used to determine
if an image file has valid/illegal pixel color values.

Currently the example script uses PIL and pylab to extract, process and draw the
color information. Next steps will be the generation of a nuke node which performs
in a similar way.
